[b]DEV NOTES[/b]
[quote=About this mod]That was a fun mod to code ^^ I already made a goat fly in the Ghost Goat mod so I reused the base of this mechanism.
The main challenge was to keep the physics and the controls stable when you start or stop flying. I got it working in a few hours, with a custom "landing" detection because of course the engine don't detect it automatically when you are flying >_<
Then I had to activate the "fly" animation on the bird but the game definitely wanted to play the original "walk" and "run" animations instead... So I ended up removing all the animations of the pawn during flight and replacing them by the fly animation only.
